    "options": [
      "Both can achieve the same result, but 'while True' with break offers more control over exit points",
      "They are completely different and cannot be used interchangeably",
      "'while True' always creates an infinite loop",
      "Conditional while loops are faster"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Both patterns can achieve similar results, but 'while True' with break allows exiting from anywhere in the loop body."
